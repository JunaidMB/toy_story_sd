# Running the FASTAPI App

Run the `fastapi_sd_ngrok.ipynb` notebook in a Google Colab instance with GPU runtime enabled. This is a prototype. Once the API endpoint is running, use the `request.py` script to test it.

## Next steps
1. Implement task queues for a long running process
2. Ammend inference function to fix 5 number of steps vs 2
3. Find a way to run the app with GPUs properly vs a collab notebook
4. Make into a webapp and integrate with a frontend
